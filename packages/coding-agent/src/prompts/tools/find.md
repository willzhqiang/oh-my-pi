Finds files using fast pattern matching that works with any codebase size.

<instruction>
- Pattern includes the search path: `src/**/*.ts`, `lib/*.json`, `**/*.md`
- You may provide comma-separated path lists, for example `apps/,packages/,phases/`
- Simple patterns like `*.ts` automatically search recursively from cwd
- Includes hidden files by default (use `hidden: false` to exclude)
- You **SHOULD** perform multiple searches in parallel when potentially useful
</instruction>

<output>
Matching file paths relative to the current working directory, sorted by modification time (most recent first). Results should be directly reusable with other file tools. Truncated at 1000 entries or 50KB (configurable via `limit`).
</output>

<example name="find files">
```
{
  "pattern": "src/**/*.ts",
  "limit": 1000
}
```
</example>

<avoid>
For open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds of globbing and grepping, you **MUST** use Task tool instead.

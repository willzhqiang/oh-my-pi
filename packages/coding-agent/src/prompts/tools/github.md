GitHub CLI tool with a single op-based dispatch. Wraps `gh` for repository, issue, pull request, search, checkout, push, and Actions watch workflows.

<instruction>
Pick the operation via `op`. Each op uses a subset of the parameters:
- `repo_view` — Read repository metadata. Optional `repo` (owner/repo) and `branch`. Falls back to the current checkout or default `gh` repo.
- `issue_view` — Read an issue. Required `issue` (number or URL). Optional `repo`. Set `comments: false` to skip discussion.
- `pr_view` — Read a pull request, including reviews and inline review comments. Optional `pr` (number, URL, or branch); omitting it targets the current branch's PR. Optional `repo`. Set `comments: false` for a lighter summary.
- `pr_diff` — Read a pull request diff. Optional `pr`, `repo`. Set `nameOnly: true` for changed file names. Use `exclude` to drop generated paths from the diff.
- `pr_checkout` — Check a pull request out into a dedicated git worktree. Optional `pr`, `repo`, `branch` (local), `worktree` (path), `force` (reset existing local branch).
- `pr_push` — Push a checked-out PR branch back to its source branch. Requires the branch to have been checked out via `op: pr_checkout` (carries push metadata). Optional `branch`; defaults to the current checked-out git branch. Optional `forceWithLease`.
- `search_issues` — Search issues using normal GitHub issue search syntax. Required `query`. Optional `repo`, `limit`.
- `search_prs` — Search pull requests using normal GitHub PR search syntax. Required `query`. Optional `repo`, `limit`.
- `run_watch` — Watch a GitHub Actions workflow run. Optional `run` (id or URL). Omitting `run` watches all workflow runs for the current HEAD commit; `branch` falls back to the current branch. Optional `tail` (log lines per failed job). Streams snapshots, fast-fails on the first detected job failure (with a brief grace period to capture concurrent failures), then fetches tailed logs for the failed jobs. The full failed-job logs are saved as a session artifact for on-demand reads.

<output>
Returns a concise readable summary tailored to the chosen op (repo/issue/PR metadata, diff text, search results, checkout info, push target, or workflow run snapshot). For `run_watch`, the full failed-job logs are saved as a session artifact when failures occur.

Performs structural code search using AST matching via native ast-grep.

<instruction>
- Use when syntax shape matters more than raw text (calls, declarations, specific language constructs)
- `path` is required and accepts a file, directory, glob, comma-separated path list, or internal URL
- Language is inferred from `path`; narrow `path` to one language when mixed-language trees could cause parse noise
- `pat` is a single AST pattern. Run separate calls for distinct unrelated patterns
- **Patterns match AST structure, not text** — whitespace/formatting is ignored
- `$NAME` captures one node; `$_` matches one without binding; `$$$NAME` captures zero-or-more (lazy — stops at next matchable element); `$$$` matches zero-or-more without binding. Use `$$$NAME`, **NOT** `$$NAME` — the two-dollar form is invalid and produces a parse error
- Metavariable names are UPPERCASE and must be the whole AST node — partial-text like `prefix$VAR`, `"hello $NAME"`, or `a $OP b` does NOT work; match the whole node instead
- When the same metavariable appears twice, both occurrences **MUST** match identical code (`$A == $A` matches `x == x`, not `x == y`)
- Patterns **MUST** parse as a single valid AST node for the inferred target language. For method fragments or body snippets that don't parse standalone, wrap in valid context (e.g. `class $_ { … }`)
- C++ qualified calls used as expression statements need the statement semicolon in the pattern: use `ns::doThing($ARG);`, `$CALLEE($ARG);`, or wrap a statement snippet. Without `;`, tree-sitter-cpp may parse `ns::doThing($ARG)` as declaration-like syntax and return no matches
- For TS declarations/methods, tolerate unknown annotations: `async function $NAME($$$ARGS): $_ { $$$BODY }` or `class $_ { method($ARG: $_): $_ { $$$BODY } }`
- Declaration forms are structurally distinct — top-level `function foo`, class method `foo()`, and `const foo = () => {}` are different AST shapes; search the right form before concluding absence
- Loosest existence check: `pat: "executeBash"` with a narrow `path`
</instruction>

<output>
- Grouped matches with file path, byte range, line/column ranges, metavariable captures
- Match lines are anchor-prefixed: `LINE+ID>content` for the matched line and `LINE+ID:content` for surrounding context
- Summary counts (`totalMatches`, `filesWithMatches`, `filesSearched`) and parse issues when present
</output>

<examples>
# Search TypeScript files under src
`{"pat":"console.log($$$)","path":"src/**/*.ts"}`
# Named imports from a specific package
`{"pat":"import { $$$IMPORTS } from \"react\"","path":"src/**/*.ts"}`
# Arrow functions assigned to a const
`{"pat":"const $NAME = ($$$ARGS) => $BODY","path":"src/utils/**/*.ts"}`
# Method call on any object, ignoring method name with `$_`
`{"pat":"logger.$_($$$ARGS)","path":"src/**/*.ts"}`
# Loosest existence check for a symbol in one file
`{"pat":"processItems","path":"src/worker.ts"}`
</examples>

<critical>
- Avoid repo-root scans — narrow `path` first
- Parse issues are query failure, not evidence of absence: repair the pattern or tighten `path` before concluding "no matches"
- For broad/open-ended exploration across subsystems, use Task tool with explore subagent first
</critical>
